# Sample size or power calculation for microbiome studies 

This repository is aimed to evaluate sample size or power for hypothesis testing in published microbiome studies according to the IMPACTT guideline. IMPACTT is short for the Integrated Microbiome Platforms for Advancing Causation Testing and Translation. 

Two papers that document IMPACTT experts' guideline are as follows, 

1. The rise to power of the microbiome: power and sample size calculation for microbiome studies (2022)

2. Beta-diversity distance matrices for microbiome sample size and power calculations - how to obtain good estimates (2021) 

I am interested in applying the framework introduced in the guidelines to evaluate sample-size or power for hypothesis tests in selected published studies, including a piglet trial conducted in my PhD studies.
